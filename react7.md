#### A re-render means React updates and redraws the component on the screen when its state or props change.

#### In simplest terms:

##### React runs the function again to calculate the new UI.
- It then updates only the changed parts in the browser.
- ##### Think of it as React "rechecking" and refreshing the component's look when something important (data/state) changes.
